Prority goes from bottom to top in this list

### Default binding

```js
var myFunction = function() {
   console.log(this);
}

myFunction();   
// call site of function defines scope of `this` inside function
```

### Implicit binding

```js
var object = {
	name: 'John',
	greet: function(person) {
      console.log("Hi " + person +", my name is " + this.name);
	}
}

object.greet("Mark");  // Hi Mark, my name is John
// `this` is defined by object before the dot
var fx = object.greet;
fx("Mark");   // Hi Mark, my name is 
// fx refers to the function itself, not the object
// meaining that default binding applies, refers to scope of call site
```

### Explicit binding

```js
var boundFunction = greet.bind(object); 
// an object is bound to a function to define `this` scope is the bound object
boundFunction(); // greets object
```

### `new` binding

```js
function constructorFoo(){
  this.name = 'hello'
}
var newObj = new constructorFoo()
// because we are using the 'new' keyword, 
// the `this` inside the function will refer to the 
// object that is being created and that is returned from the constructor
```

### arrow function binding

`this` inside an arrow function will always refer to the lexical scope
arrow functions can't be ran with `new`

## `new` Keyword and Prototypes

Useful for inheritance, replaces `__prototype__` of created object with the `.prototype` attribute of the constructor function, the constructor function is the function passed after `new` keyword

```js
obj1 = new ObjMaker();
```

## Prototype

An object's prototype defines functions that the object has by 'default'

Each object has an inaccessible `__prototype__`

When creating an object with `newObj = new foo` the new object's `__proto__`(hidden) will reference `foo.prototype` property(not hidden). This means that changing the `foo.prototype` proprty will reflect on all objects created with `new foo`. However if `foo.prototype` is later assigned a new object, then it won't alter the `__proto__` of the objects that were created with it previously.

`__prototype__` can only be set on an object during its creation

`Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)`: allows read access to inaccessible `__proto__`

We can link prototypes of different objects:

```js
ConstructorFoo.prototype = new ConstructorWithPrototype()
//remember, constructors are just normal functions
//they might have a 'prototype' property
```


## bind()

can be used for currying `foo.bind(null, param)`



### example

```js
const lexicalBinding = () => {
    const name = 'Dea'
    console.log(this.name)
}
function defaultBinding(){
    const name = 'NotGonnaBePrinted'
    console.log(this.name)
}

const name = 'Jay'
function afunction(){
    const name = 'John'
    defaultBinding(); // prints 'John'
    lexicalBinding() // prints 'Dea', doesn't matter where it is called for
}
defaultBinding(); //prints 'Jay' 
lexicalBinding() // prints 'Dea', doesn't matter where it is called for
```
